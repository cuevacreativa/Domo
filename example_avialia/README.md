# ExampleAvialia

This example demonstrates keeping the consistency of the domain model with Domo. 
The domain model is for an air carrier company.

It has two contexts board passengers and cargo shipments backed 
by two Ecto repositories, respectfully. That demonstrates how Domo can 
be applied in microservices setup if these two contexts are extracted 
into separate apps.

The application persists the changeset validated by Domo if it matches 
appropriate schema `t()` type definition and associated preconditions. 
Otherwise, it shows the changeset's errors prepared by Domo to the user.

To open the application, start the Phoenix server and visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) 
from your browser. You can enter some data, see errors, persist or delete records.

Domo can be applied to build and validate any struct defined with `t()` type by itself.
Because each struct that `use Domo` automatically gets `new/1`, `ensure_type!/1/2` 
functions and their `*_ok` versions.

Domo works with any struct defined with `defstruct/1` and `t()` type. 
It adds `new/1`, `ensure_type!/1/2` functions and their `*_ok` versions to the struct.

You can build and validate the `Passenger` struct directly with Domo with the following:

`iex -S mix`

```
alias ExampleAvialia.Boardings.Passenger

p = Passenger.new!(flight: "ALA-1215", first_name: "John", last_name: "Smith", seat: "5C")

Passenger.ensure_type!(%{p | flight: "invalid"})

alias ExampleAvialia.Cargos.Shipment

{:ok, s} = Shipment.new(flight: "ALA-1215", kind: {:passenger_baggage, "5C"}, weight: {:kilograms, 29}, documents_count: 0, documents: [])

Shipment.ensure_type(%{s | kind: {:passenger_baggage, "invalid"}}, maybe_filter_precond_errors: true)
```

### To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
